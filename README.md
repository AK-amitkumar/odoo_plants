Plant nursery module
====================

This module is a simple usecase to present the Odoo framework during the
Odoodays 2017. It is inspired by work from @mart-e . It showcases
a module to manage plants and a small frontend page to display them
to customers.

See the [commit history](https://github.com/tde-banana-odoo/odoo_plants/commits/master/)
to follow the evolution of the module.

It targets Odoo v11 and commits show the various feature addition presented
in Odoo Experience 2017 talks (Make your app frontend compatible and
Empower your app using odoo mixins)
